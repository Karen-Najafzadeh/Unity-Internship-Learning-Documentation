# User Authentication with Steam – Full Documentation

## 1. Overview

User authentication via Steam allows your Unity game to verify that a player is logged into the Steam client and owns a valid Steam account. This process leverages the Steamworks API (wrapped by Steamworks.NET for Unity) to generate a unique authentication ticket that can be validated on your backend server or used directly in your game logic. This method ensures secure login and enables integration with other Steam features, like achievements and leaderboards.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following:

- **Steamworks Developer Account:**  
  You must be registered as a Steamworks developer and have an application set up. This provides you with the necessary **Steam Application ID** and access to the Steamworks dashboard.  
  ([Steamworks Documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home)).

- **Steam Web API Key:**  
  Generate a Web API Key from the Steamworks dashboard. This key is required for server-side verification of tickets.

- **Unity Installation:**  
  A working Unity project (Unity 2021 or later is recommended).

- **Steamworks.NET:**  
  Download and import the latest version of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases) into your Unity project. This wrapper provides managed C# access to the native Steamworks SDK.

- **steam_appid.txt:**  
  Place a `steam_appid.txt` file at the root of your Unity project (or alongside your executable when running) that contains your Steam Application ID. This file tells Steamworks.NET which application context it should use.

---

## 3. Initialization

### A. SteamManager Setup

- **SteamManager Script:**  
  The Steamworks.NET package includes a `SteamManager` MonoBehaviour that initializes and shuts down the Steam API. Create an empty GameObject (e.g., “SteamManager”) and attach this script.  
  - Make sure that the Steam client is running and that the user is logged in.

- **Initialization Check:**  
  In your code, always check if Steam is initialized before performing any Steam API calls to avoid runtime errors. For example:
  ```csharp
  if (!SteamManager.Initialized)
  {
      Debug.LogError("Steam is not initialized; ensure the Steam client is running and you are logged in.");
      return;
  }
  ```

## 4. Generating an Authentication Ticket

### A. The Authentication Flow

When a user attempts to authenticate, your Unity game should:
1. **Generate an Auth Ticket:**  
   Request an authentication session ticket using `SteamUser.GetAuthSessionTicket`.  
2. **Convert the Ticket:**  
   Since the ticket is returned as a byte array, convert it into a hexadecimal string. This string is more manageable for transmission (e.g., sending it to a server for verification) or embedding in a login request.
3. **Optional – Ticket Cancellation:**  
   After successful authentication, you can call `SteamUser.CancelAuthTicket` to free up resources related to the ticket.

### B. Code Sample

Below is an example of how to generate and use a Steam authentication ticket in Unity and some useful methoods:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Text;
using Steamworks;
using Nightingale.Utilitys;
using System.Collections.Generic;

/// <summary>
/// Manages Steam authentication for the Unity application.
/// Handles generating Steam authentication tickets, signing in with Steam, and retrieving user information.
/// </summary>
public class SteamAuthManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    /// <summary>

    public static SteamAuthManager Instance { get; private set; }

    private HAuthTicket m_HAuthTicket;
    private Callback<GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t> m_AuthTicketForWebApiResponseCallback;
    private string m_SessionTicket;
    private string identity = "unityauthenticationservice";


    #region initialization
    /// <summary>
    /// Ensures a single instance of the SteamAuthExample class exists.
    /// </summary>
    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance == null)
        {
            Instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        }
        else
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the script starts. Initializes Steam authentication and retrieves the session ticket.
    /// </summary>
    public void Start()
    {
        if (!SteamManager.Initialized)
        {
            Debug.LogError("Steam is not initialized! Please check that the Steam client is running and you are logged in.");
            return;
        }

        m_SessionTicket = GetSteamAuthToken();
        Debug.Log("Steam Auth Token: " + m_SessionTicket);
        SignInWithSteam();
    }

    /// <summary>

    /// </summary>
    void SignInWithSteam()
    {
        m_AuthTicketForWebApiResponseCallback = Callback<GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t>.Create(OnAuthCallback);
        SteamUser.GetAuthTicketForWebApi(identity);
    }

    /// <summary>

    void OnAuthCallback(GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t callback)
    {
        m_AuthTicketForWebApiResponseCallback.Dispose();
        m_AuthTicketForWebApiResponseCallback = null;
        Debug.Log("Steam Login success. Session Ticket: " + m_SessionTicket);
        Debug.Log("Steam Persona Name: " + GetPersonaName());
        Debug.Log("Steam ID: " +GetSteamID());
        Debug.Log("Steam Friends List: " + GetFriendsList());
    }

    /// <summary>

    public string GetSteamAuthToken()
    {
        byte[] ticketBlob = new byte[1024];
        uint ticketSize;

        // Request an authentication ticket from Steam.
        SteamNetworkingIdentity steamNetworkingIdentity = new SteamNetworkingIdentity();
        m_HAuthTicket = SteamUser.GetAuthSessionTicket(ticketBlob, ticketBlob.Length, out ticketSize, ref steamNetworkingIdentity);

        if (ticketSize == 0)
        {
            Debug.LogError("Failed to get a valid Steam auth ticket.");
            return string.Empty;
        }

        StringBuilder tokenBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < ticketSize; i++)
        {

    /// </summary>
    public void CancelAuthTicket()
    {

    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **GetAuthSessionTicket:**  
  This method populates a byte array with the authentication ticket data and returns a handle (`HAuthTicket`).  
- **Conversion to Hexadecimal:**  
  The loop converts each byte from the ticket into a two-digit hexadecimal string to form the complete token.
- **Usage:**  
  The generated token should then be sent to your secure backend where you use Steam’s Web API (specifically the `ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket` endpoint) to verify its legitimacy.


---

## 5. Server-Side Ticket Verification

Although the client generates the ticket, it is critical from a security perspective that your server verifies the ticket. Here’s an outline of the process:

### A. Verification Endpoint
- **Steam Web API Endpoint:**  
  Use the following endpoint to verify the ticket:
  ```
  https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket/v1/?key=YOUR_API_KEY&appid=YOUR_APP_ID&ticket=YOUR_HEX_TICKET
  ```
  
- **Parameters:**
  - `key`: Your Steam Web API key.
  - `appid`: Your Steam Application ID.
  - `ticket`: The hexadecimal ticket string generated on the client.

### B. Process Flow

1. **Client Sends Token:**  
   After generating the token, the client sends it (over HTTPS) to your game server.
2. **Server Makes Verification Request:**  
   The server uses the provided token along with your API key and AppID to call the Steam Web API.
3. **Steam Returns Verification Data:**  
   The API will respond with a JSON object that includes a “result” field and the user’s SteamID if the ticket is valid.
4. **Match Against Local Data:**  
   The server can then match the returned SteamID with existing user data or create a new account if it’s the player’s first login.

**Security Note:**  
Never trust solely the client’s data. Always validate and verify tickets server-side to avoid spoofing or replay attacks.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Authentication

- **Ensure Robust Initialization:**  
  Always check that the Steam client and Steamworks are properly initialized before making any API calls.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Implement robust error handling. If `GetAuthSessionTicket` returns an empty or invalid ticket, log the issue and prompt the user with an appropriate message.

- **Resource Cleanup:**  
  Cancel authentication tickets using `SteamUser.CancelAuthTicket` when they are no longer needed, to free up system resources.

- **Secure Communication:**  
  Use secure channels (HTTPS) for all server communications. Your server must verify each ticket with the Steam Web API.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  Keep detailed logs on both client and server to track authentication attempts, failures, and to assist in debugging any issues that may arise.


---

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues:
- **Steam Not Running or User Not Logged In:**  
  Ensure the Steam client is active before starting your game. The `SteamManager.Initialized` property should be `true` on startup.
  
- **Invalid or Zero-Length Ticket:**  
  If the returned ticket size is zero, double-check that the Steam client is properly logged in and that your `steam_appid.txt` file is correctly configured with your AppID.

- **Network Communication:**  
  Verify that your game server can access Steam’s Web API without firewall issues or network restrictions.

### Debugging Techniques:
- **Unity Console Logging:**  
  Use detailed `Debug.Log()` statements to track each stage of the authentication process.
- **Steamworks Logging:**  
  Enable verbose logging within Steamworks.NET (if available) to capture API response details.
- **Backend Logging:**  
  Log all requests and responses in your backend when performing ticket verification. This can help diagnose issues related to API key mismatches or network errors.

- **Unique Identifier:**  
  The authenticated user is associated with a unique SteamID. This allows you to uniquely identify a player in your game and on your backend.
  
- **Player Profile Details:**  
  You can retrieve details such as the user’s Steam persona name, profile picture/avatar, and even other public profile information.  
  - *Example Usage:* Load a player’s display name to show in your game’s UI or use the avatar image on leaderboards and social features.

**API Call Example:**
```csharp
string personaName = SteamFriends.GetPersonaName();
Texture2D avatar = GetSteamAvatar();  // Custom method to load avatar; see Steamworks.NET documentation for details.
```

---

### 9.2. Achievements and In-Game Rewards

**Unlocking Achievements:**  
- **Enhance Player Engagement:**  
  With the authenticated user, you can award achievements when players meet specific in-game milestones.
- **Usage:**  
  When a condition is met (e.g., completing a level or defeating a boss), call:
  ```csharp
  SteamUserStats.SetAchievement("ACH_WIN_FIRST_LEVEL");
  SteamUserStats.StoreStats();
  ```

**Benefits:**  
- Provides players with measurable goals and rewards.
- Encourages extended gameplay and competition among friends.

---

### 9.3. Leaderboards and Competitive Rankings

**Setting Up Leaderboards:**  
- **Score Uploading:**  
  Use the authenticated user’s data to post scores to a global or friend-specific leaderboard.
- **Retrieving Rankings:**  
  Use Steamworks API to fetch leaderboard data and display it in your game.
  
**Example:**  
```csharp
// Pseudocode example for uploading a score:
SteamUserStats.UploadLeaderboardScore(leaderboardHandle, ELeaderboardUploadScoreMethod.k_ELeaderboardUploadScoreMethodKeepBest, playerScore, null, 0);
```

**Impact:**  
- Fosters a competitive environment.
- Allows players to track their performance compared to others.

---

### 9.4. Social Integration: Friends List and Multiplayer Features

**Friends and Social Data:**  
- **Fetching Friends List:**  
  The authentication token enables you to pull the player’s Steam friends list.  
  - *Example:* You can show online friends in a multiplayer lobby or allow players to invite friends to join a game session.
- **Multiplayer Integration:**  
  Use the authenticated SteamID to link to in-game multiplayer sessions or voice chat services.
  
**Usage Scenario:**  
- Display your friends’ avatars and status, then allow quick invites or chat initiation in your game’s interface.

---

### 9.5. Cloud Saves and Cross-Device Persistence

  - Purchase character skins or new levels.
  - Manage a player’s virtual inventory that persists across sessions.

---

### 9.7. Backend Account Linking and Enhanced Security

**Integrating with Your Game’s Backend:**
- **Account Linking:**  
  After authentication, you can link the Steam user with an internal account on your game server. This enables you to:
  - Manage player progress, purchases, and settings in a centralized database.
  - Offer cross-platform gameplay if the same account is linked to other login methods.
  
- **Security Measures:**  
  The Steam authentication token can be used to verify a user’s legitimacy on your backend server. By calling the Steam Web API (using your Steam Web API key and AppID), you can confirm that the token is valid and that the user truly owns a Steam account. This is critical for preventing spoofing or fraudulent activities.

**Security Workflow:**
1. **Client:** Sends the authentication token to your backend.
2. **Server:** Uses the token to call the Steam Web API endpoint:
   ```
   https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket/v1/?key=YOUR_API_KEY&appid=YOUR_APP_ID&ticket=YOUR_HEX_TICKET
   ```
3. **Response:** If valid, the server receives the SteamID and other details, which can then be linked to a player profile in your game’s database.

---

### 9.8. Additional Possibilities Enabled by Authentication

**Extended Social Features:**  
- Integrate Steam Overlay for inviting friends or accessing community features without leaving your game.
  
**Rich Analytics and Metrics:**
