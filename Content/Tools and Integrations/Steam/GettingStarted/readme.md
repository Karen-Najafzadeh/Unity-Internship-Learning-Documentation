# Steam & Steamworks SDK Integration in Unity

This repository documents my learnings during my Unity internship, with a focus on integrating Steam authentication, achievements, leaderboards, cloud saves, and user statistics using Steamworks SDK and Steamworks.NET.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate Steam features into a Unity game. With Steamworks SDK and Steamworks.NET, you can:
- Authenticate users with their Steam account
- Unlock achievements based on in-game events
- Manage leaderboards to rank players globally or among friends
- Use Steam Cloud for saving and syncing game data
- Retrieve and track user statistics

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Unity:** A Unity project (Unity 2021 or later is recommended).
- **Steamworks Account:** A registered Steamworks account. You’ll need your Steam Application ID and a Steam Web API Key.
- **Steamworks SDK:** Access to the official [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/) via your Steamworks account.
- **Steamworks.NET:** The C# wrapper for Steamworks. Download the latest Unity package from the [Steamworks.NET GitHub repository](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET).

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Steamworks Environment

1. **Log into Steamworks:**  
   - Navigate to [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) and sign in.
   - Create or select your game to obtain the **Steam Application ID**.

2. **Generate Your Steam Web API Key:**  
   - In the Steamworks dashboard, follow Valve’s instructions to create your Web API Key.  
   - This key is necessary for backend validation and additional API calls.

3. **Configure Your Steam App:**  
   - Through the Steamworks dashboard, configure achievements, leaderboards, and other features you intend to use.

### 2. Import Steamworks.NET into Your Unity Project

1. **Download the Package:**  
   - Get the latest Steamworks.NET Unity package from [Steamworks.NET GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases).

2. **Import into Unity:**  
   - In your Unity project, use **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package…** to import the downloaded package.

3. **Create/update `steam_appid.txt`:**  
   - In your project’s root folder, create (or update) a file named `steam_appid.txt` and insert your Steam Application ID. This file informs Steamworks.NET which app you’re testing against.

### 3. Initialize Steam in Your Project

1. **Attach SteamManager:**  
   - The Steamworks.NET package comes with a `SteamManager` MonoBehaviour. Attach it to a dedicated GameObject (e.g., a “SteamManager” object) in your starting scene.
   - This script initializes the Steam API automatically when your game starts.

2. **Check Initialization:**
   - Make sure Steam is running and you’re logged in before playing in the Unity Editor.

### 4. Authentication with Steam

Integrate Steam authentication into your game by generating an authentication ticket and forwarding it to your backend or authentication service.

**Example Code:**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Text;
using Steamworks;

public class SteamAuthExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Called when the login button is pressed
    public void OnLoginButtonClicked()
    {
        if (!SteamManager.Initialized)
        {
            Debug.LogError("Steam is not initialized! Are you logged in?");
            return;
        }
        string steamToken = GetSteamToken();
        Debug.Log("Steam Auth Token: " + steamToken);
        // Send steamToken to your server for validation or use it directly with your authentication service.
    }

    // Generates a Steam authentication ticket and converts it to a hex string
    public string GetSteamToken()
    {
        byte[] ticketBlob = new byte[1024];
        uint ticketSize;
        HAuthTicket authTicket = SteamUser.GetAuthSessionTicket(ticketBlob, ticketBlob.Length, out ticketSize);

        StringBuilder tokenBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < ticketSize; i++)
        {
            tokenBuilder.AppendFormat("{0:x2}", ticketBlob[i]);
        }
        return tokenBuilder.ToString();
    }

    // Optionally, cancel the ticket when no longer needed
    public void CancelTicket(HAuthTicket ticket)
    {
        SteamUser.CancelAuthTicket(ticket);
    }
}
```

*This snippet demonstrates how to generate and log a Steam authentication token. For production, forward the token to your secure server for Steam API validation ([Steamworks Documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home)).*

### 5. Additional Steamworks Features

#### Achievements
- **Unlock Achievements:**  
  In Steam, achievements are managed in your Steamworks dashboard. In Unity, unlock an achievement as follows:
  ```csharp
  SteamUserStats.SetAchievement("ACHIEVEMENT_ID");
  SteamUserStats.StoreStats();
  ```
- **Usage:** Rewards players for reaching milestones, boosting engagement.

#### Leaderboards
- **Manage Rankings:**  
  Upload scores and retrieve ranking data with:
  ```csharp
  // Example: Upload score (detailed implementation will depend on your game logic)
  SteamUserStats.UploadLeaderboardScore(/* parameters */);
  ```
- **Usage:** Display global or friend-based leaderboards in your game.

#### Cloud Saves
- **Synchronize Data:**  
  Enable Steam Cloud in the Steamworks dashboard to automatically save and sync player data.
- **Usage:** Offer a seamless save/load experience across devices.

#### User Statistics
- **Track In-game Metrics:**  
  Retrieve statistics like playtime or enemies defeated:
  ```csharp
  int statValue;
  SteamUserStats.GetStat("STAT_NAME", out statValue);
  ```
- **Usage:** Use these stats for achievements or player feedback.

### 6. Best Practices

- **Error Handling:**  
  Always check if Steam is initialized before calling any API functions. Provide fallback messages if initialization fails.
- **Security:**  
  Validate authentication tickets on your server using Steam’s Web API to guard against spoofing.
- **Resource Management:**  
  Cancel any unused authentication tickets with `SteamUser.CancelAuthTicket` to avoid resource leaks.
- **Stay Updated:**  
  Regularly consult the [official Steamworks documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home) and [Steamworks.NET GitHub page](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) for updates.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- **Initialization Errors:**  
  Ensure the Steam client is running and that `steam_appid.txt` contains the correct Steam Application ID.
- **Authentication Failures:**  
  Verify your integration settings and confirm that your Steam API key and App ID are correct in your Steamworks dashboard.
- **Debugging:**  
  Utilize Unity’s Console for logging Steam events and errors.

## Further Resources

- **Steamworks SDK Documentation:**  
  Read the [Steamworks API documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home) for in-depth details.
- **Steamworks.NET:**  
  Visit the [Steamworks.NET GitHub](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) for updates, sample projects, and community support.
