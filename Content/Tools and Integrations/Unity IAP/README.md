## Introduction

Unity IAP provides a streamlined way to implement in-app purchases across multiple platforms. Whether you’re selling consumable items, non-consumables, or subscriptions, Unity IAP integrates directly with platform-specific stores (Google Play, App Store, etc.), handling the heavy lifting of purchase validation and transaction processing.

---

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Importing Unity IAP Package

#### Via Unity Package Manager
1. Open **Unity Package Manager**:  
   `Window` → `Package Manager`.
2. Locate **In-App Purchasing** in the list of packages.
3. Click **Install**.

#### Via Unity Services
1. In the Unity Editor, navigate to **Window** → **General** → **Services**.
2. Enable **In-App Purchasing** under the Services tab.
3. Follow the guided steps to set up your project.

---

## Configuration

### 1. Setting Up Your Product Catalog

Before coding, define your products in a centralized catalog:
- Create a list of product IDs in your code (or use a configuration file) that match those set up in the respective store dashboards.
- Classify each product as **Consumable**, **Non-Consumable**, or **Subscription**.

Example:
```csharp
public static class IAPProducts {
    public const string consumableProduct = "com.yourcompany.yourgame.consumable";
    public const string nonConsumableProduct = "com.yourcompany.yourgame.nonconsumable";
    public const string subscriptionProduct = "com.yourcompany.yourgame.subscription";
}
```

### 2. Configuring the IAP Manager

Create a dedicated manager script (e.g., `IAPManager`) to handle initialization and purchasing logic.

---

## Implementing In-App Purchases

### Product Types

- **Consumable:** Items that can be purchased multiple times (e.g., coins, power-ups).
- **Non-Consumable:** Items purchased once (e.g., premium features, ad removal).
- **Subscription:** Recurring purchases (e.g., monthly or yearly memberships).

### Initializing the IAP Manager

Implement the `IStoreListener` interface to initialize Unity IAP:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Purchasing;
using System;

public class IAPManager : MonoBehaviour, IStoreListener
{
    private static IStoreController storeController;
    private static IExtensionProvider storeExtensionProvider;

    void Start()
    {
        if (storeController == null)
        {
            InitializePurchasing();
        }
    }

    public void InitializePurchasing()
    {
        if (IsInitialized()) return;

        // Create a builder for IAP configuration
        var builder = ConfigurationBuilder.Instance(StandardPurchasingModule.Instance());

        // Add products (ensure the IDs match your store settings)
        builder.AddProduct(IAPProducts.consumableProduct, ProductType.Consumable);
        builder.AddProduct(IAPProducts.nonConsumableProduct, ProductType.NonConsumable);
        builder.AddProduct(IAPProducts.subscriptionProduct, ProductType.Subscription);

        UnityPurchasing.Initialize(this, builder);
    }

    private bool IsInitialized()
    {
        return storeController != null && storeExtensionProvider != null;
    }

    // Called when Unity IAP is initialized successfully
    public void OnInitialized(IStoreController controller, IExtensionProvider extensions)
    {
        Debug.Log("Unity IAP initialization successful.");
        storeController = controller;
        storeExtensionProvider = extensions;
    }

    // Called when Unity IAP fails to initialize
    public void OnInitializeFailed(InitializationFailureReason error)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Unity IAP Initialization Failed: " + error);
    }
}
```

### Making Purchases

Create a method to trigger a purchase:
```csharp
public void BuyProduct(string productId)
{
    if (IsInitialized())
    {
        Product product = storeController.products.WithID(productId);

        if (product != null && product.availableToPurchase)
        {
            Debug.Log("Purchasing product: " + product.definition.id);
            storeController.InitiatePurchase(product);
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("Purchase failed: Product not found or unavailable.");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.LogWarning("Purchase failed: IAP not initialized.");
    }
}
```

### Handling Purchase Callbacks

Implement purchase processing and failure handling:
```csharp
public PurchaseProcessingResult ProcessPurchase(PurchaseEventArgs args)
{
    if (String.Equals(args.purchasedProduct.definition.id, IAPProducts.consumableProduct, StringComparison.Ordinal))
    {
        Debug.Log("Consumable product purchased successfully.");
        // Grant consumable rewards (e.g., coins)
    }
    else if (String.Equals(args.purchasedProduct.definition.id, IAPProducts.nonConsumableProduct, StringComparison.Ordinal))
    {
        Debug.Log("Non-consumable product purchased successfully.");
        // Unlock features or remove ads
    }
    else if (String.Equals(args.purchasedProduct.definition.id, IAPProducts.subscriptionProduct, StringComparison.Ordinal))
    {
        Debug.Log("Subscription product purchased successfully.");
        // Enable subscription content
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.LogWarning("Unrecognized product: " + args.purchasedProduct.definition.id);
    }

    // Return Complete to signal Unity IAP that the process is done.
    return PurchaseProcessingResult.Complete;
}

public void OnPurchaseFailed(Product product, PurchaseFailureReason failureReason)
{
    Debug.LogError($"Purchase failed for product {product.definition.storeSpecificId}: {failureReason}");
}
```

---

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android
- **Google Play Console:** Ensure your product IDs are registered in your Google Play Console.
- **Testing:** Use license testers in your Play Console to test purchases without actual charges.
- **ProGuard:** Update ProGuard rules if using code obfuscation.

### iOS
- **App Store Connect:** Register your in-app products in App Store Connect.
- **Sandbox Testing:** Use a Sandbox tester account to verify transactions.
- **Info.plist:** Ensure all necessary IAP keys are configured in your `Info.plist`.

### Other Platforms
- **Unity IAP supports multiple platforms.** Always verify that your product IDs and settings align with the specific store requirements for each platform you plan to support.

---

## Debugging and Testing

### Enable Debug Logs
- Use `Debug.Log` statements to trace initialization and purchase events.
- In the Unity Editor, simulate purchases using Unity IAP’s built-in testing tools.

### Testing with Real Devices
- **Android:** Use test devices with the correct Google account registered as a tester.
- **iOS:** Run your app on a device using Sandbox mode for in-app purchases.

### Handling Edge Cases
- Test scenarios like network failures or cancellations to ensure your code handles exceptions gracefully.
- Consider implementing receipt validation for additional security.

---

## Price Localization

When Unity IAP initializes and fetches products from the store, each product comes with metadata that includes localized pricing information. This allows you to display prices in the user’s local currency automatically.

---


### Product Metadata
Each IAP product in Unity has a `ProductMetadata` object containing:

- **localizedPrice:**  
  The price as a decimal, localized to the user’s region.
  
- **localizedPriceString:**  
  A formatted string that includes the price along with the appropriate currency sign (e.g., "$0.99", "€0,89"). This string is generated based on the store's data.
  
- **isoCurrencyCode:**  
  A string representing the ISO currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR").

### How It Works
- **Automatic Localization:**  
  When you define your products in the store dashboards (Google Play, App Store), you set a base price. The stores then convert and display these prices based on the user’s region. Unity IAP retrieves this data, so you don't have to perform any manual conversions.
  
- **Store-Provided Values:**  
  The values you get (like `localizedPriceString`) come directly from the store. This ensures that users see prices in their local format and currency.

---

### Practical Example

When initializing Unity IAP, you can access these localized values once the products are loaded:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Purchasing;

public class IAPManager : MonoBehaviour, IStoreListener {
    private static IStoreController storeController;

    public void OnInitialized(IStoreController controller, IExtensionProvider extensions) {
        Debug.Log("Unity IAP initialization successful.");
        storeController = controller;
        // Example: Display localized prices for each product
        DisplayLocalizedPrices();
    }

    private void DisplayLocalizedPrices() {
        foreach (var product in storeController.products.all) {
            Debug.Log(
                $"Product ID: {product.definition.id}\n" +
                $"Price: {product.metadata.localizedPriceString}\n" +
                $"Currency: {product.metadata.isoCurrencyCode}"
            );
        }
    }

    // Implement other IStoreListener methods...
}
```

In this snippet:
- **OnInitialized:** The method is called when Unity IAP successfully initializes, and it provides the `IStoreController` which contains the products.
- **DisplayLocalizedPrices:** This method iterates through all products, logging the localized price string and ISO currency code. This can be used to populate your in-game store UI with accurate, localized pricing information.

---

### Best Practices

- **Always Use Store Metadata:**  
  Rely on the `localizedPriceString` and other metadata provided by Unity IAP instead of hardcoding price values. This ensures that any changes or regional pricing differences are automatically reflected.
  
- **Display Clearly:**  
  Use the localized price information in your UI to avoid confusion. This makes your store more user-friendly and compliant with local expectations.
  
- **Test on Multiple Locales:**  
  When testing your IAP integration, simulate different regions (or use VPNs/emulators) to ensure that the pricing displays correctly for users from various countries.

By leveraging Unity IAP's built-in support for price localization, you can offer a seamless purchasing experience that respects regional differences in currency and price formatting.


### SKU
**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** is a unique identifier assigned to each product. In the context of Unity IAP, the SKU typically corresponds to the product ID that you define when setting up your in-app products in the store dashboards. It’s used to track, manage, and retrieve product information—such as pricing—within your app.

Below is an example function in C# that retrieves the localized price (including the currency sign) for a given product SKU:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Purchasing;

public class IAPPriceHelper : MonoBehaviour, IStoreListener
{
    private static IStoreController storeController;
    private static IExtensionProvider storeExtensionProvider;

    // This method should be called during initialization (e.g., in Start())
    public void InitializePurchasing()
    {
        if (IsInitialized())
            return;
        
        var builder = ConfigurationBuilder.Instance(StandardPurchasingModule.Instance());
        
        // Add your products here. Replace with your actual product SKUs.
        builder.AddProduct("com.yourcompany.yourgame.consumable", ProductType.Consumable);
        builder.AddProduct("com.yourcompany.yourgame.nonconsumable", ProductType.NonConsumable);
        builder.AddProduct("com.yourcompany.yourgame.subscription", ProductType.Subscription);
        
        UnityPurchasing.Initialize(this, builder);
    }

    private bool IsInitialized()
    {
        return storeController != null && storeExtensionProvider != null;
    }

    // IStoreListener callback: Called when Unity IAP has been initialized successfully.
    public void OnInitialized(IStoreController controller, IExtensionProvider extensions)
    {
        Debug.Log("Unity IAP initialization successful.");
        storeController = controller;
        storeExtensionProvider = extensions;
    }

    public void OnInitializeFailed(InitializationFailureReason error)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Unity IAP Initialization Failed: " + error);
    }

    // IStoreListener callback for processing purchases (not needed for just fetching prices)
    public PurchaseProcessingResult ProcessPurchase(PurchaseEventArgs args)
    {
        return PurchaseProcessingResult.Complete;
    }

    public void OnPurchaseFailed(Product product, PurchaseFailureReason failureReason)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Purchase failed for product {product.definition.storeSpecificId}: {failureReason}");
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Retrieves the localized price string (with the currency sign) for the given product SKU.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="productSKU">The unique identifier (SKU) of the product.</param>
    /// <returns>A string representing the localized price, or an empty string if not available.</returns>
    public string GetLocalizedPrice(string productSKU)
    {
        if (!IsInitialized())
        {
            Debug.LogError("IAP is not initialized.");
            return "";
        }

        Product product = storeController.products.WithID(productSKU);
        if (product != null && product.availableToPurchase)
        {
            return product.metadata.localizedPriceString;
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("Product not found or not available: " + productSKU);
            return "";
        }
    }
}
```

### How It Works
- **Initialization:**  
  The `InitializePurchasing()` method sets up Unity IAP with your defined products. This must be completed before you can retrieve any product metadata.

- **GetLocalizedPrice Function:**  
  The `GetLocalizedPrice` function takes a product SKU as a parameter, checks if the IAP system is initialized, and then retrieves the corresponding `Product` object. If found and available for purchase, it returns the `localizedPriceString` which includes the proper currency sign (e.g., "$0.99", "€0,89").

- **SKU Explanation:**  
  As mentioned, the SKU uniquely identifies your product. In Unity IAP, it’s the identifier you assign to your product when adding it to the configuration builder. This ID is used to fetch the product’s metadata—including localized pricing—from the store.

This function allows you to dynamically display correct, localized pricing information in your in-game store, ensuring a better user experience for players from different regions.


## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Best Practices
- **Centralize Product IDs:** Maintain a single source of truth for product identifiers.
- **User Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback to users on purchase status (e.g., loading spinners, confirmation dialogs).
- **Security:** Consider server-side receipt validation to prevent fraudulent transactions.
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of each product and its intended functionality.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Initialization Failures:** Verify Internet connectivity and correct product configurations.
- **Purchase Failures:** Check that the product exists in your store settings and that the user’s account is authorized to make purchases.
- **Platform-Specific Issues:** Consult platform-specific guidelines (Google Play or App Store) for troubleshooting tips.
