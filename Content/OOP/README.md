Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects and classes. In C#—and especially in Unity—OOP helps you structure your code in a modular, reusable, and maintainable way. Below is a comprehensive guide covering the core OOP concepts in C# with Unity-specific examples and detailed explanations.

---

# **1. Classes and Objects**

**Classes** are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (fields/properties) and behavior (methods). An **object** is an instance of a class.

### **Example: Basic Class and Object**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Weapon
{
    // Fields (private by default)
    private string weaponName;
    private int damage;

    // Constructor: Initializes the object
    public Weapon(string name, int damage)
    {
        this.weaponName = name;
        this.damage = damage;
    }

    // Public method: Behavior of the weapon
    public void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(weaponName + " attacks dealing " + damage + " damage!");
    }

    // Property: Encapsulation of damage
    public int Damage
    {
        get { return damage; }
        set { damage = value; }
    }
}

public class WeaponTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Creating an instance (object) of Weapon
        Weapon sword = new Weapon("Excalibur", 50);
        sword.Attack();

        // Changing a property using encapsulation
        sword.Damage = 60;
        sword.Attack();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Fields & Properties:**  
  - `weaponName` and `damage` store state; `Damage` property controls access to `damage`.
- **Constructor:**  
  - `Weapon(string name, int damage)` initializes new objects.
- **Methods:**  
  - `Attack()` encapsulates behavior.
- **Object Creation:**  
  - In `WeaponTester`, we create and use a `Weapon` object.

# **2. Inheritance**

**Inheritance** allows a class (derived/child) to inherit fields and methods from another class (base/parent), promoting code reuse.

### **Example: Inheritance with Characters**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// Base class
public class Character : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string characterName;
    public int health;

    // Virtual method: Can be overridden by derived classes.
    public virtual void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(characterName + " performs a basic attack.");
    }
}

// Derived class: Inherits from Character
public class Player : Character
{
    public int mana;

    // Overriding the Attack method
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(characterName + " casts a spell attack!");
    }
}

public class Enemy : Character
{
    // New behavior specific to Enemy
    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(characterName + " lunges with a fierce strike!");
    }
}

public class InheritanceTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Create a Player and an Enemy and see polymorphic behavior
        Player player = new Player { characterName = "Hero", health = 100, mana = 50 };
        Enemy enemy = new Enemy { characterName = "Goblin", health = 60 };

        player.Attack(); // Uses Player's Attack method.
        enemy.Attack();  // Uses Enemy's Attack method.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Base Class:**  
  - `Character` holds common properties and a virtual method `Attack()`.
- **Derived Classes:**  
  - `Player` and `Enemy` override `Attack()` to provide specific implementations.
- **Polymorphism:**  
  - Even though both `Player` and `Enemy` are of type `Character`, they implement `Attack()` differently.

---

# **3. Encapsulation**

**Encapsulation** hides an object’s internal state and requires all interaction to be performed through methods or properties. This increases modularity and safeguards data integrity.

### **Example: Encapsulation with Access Modifiers**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BankAccount
{
    // Private field: Only accessible within the class.
    private float balance;

    // Public property for controlled access.
    public float Balance
    {
        get { return balance; }
        private set
        {
            if (value >= 0)
                balance = value;
        }
    }

    public BankAccount(float initialBalance)
    {
        Balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money.
    public void Deposit(float amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            Balance += amount;
            Debug.Log("Deposited: " + amount + ". New Balance: " + Balance);
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money.
    public bool Withdraw(float amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && Balance >= amount)
        {
            Balance -= amount;
            Debug.Log("Withdrew: " + amount + ". New Balance: " + Balance);
            return true;
        }
        Debug.Log("Withdrawal of " + amount + " failed. Current Balance: " + Balance);
        return false;
    }
}

public class BankTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100f);
        account.Deposit(50f);
        account.Withdraw(30f);
        // account.Balance = -100; // Error: Cannot set from outside due to private setter.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Access Modifiers:**  
  - `private` hides the balance; `public` properties and methods provide controlled access.
- **Data Protection:**  
  - The setter for `Balance` is private, ensuring it can only be modified via methods that enforce validation.

# **4. Abstraction**

**Abstraction** simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. In C#, you can use **abstract classes** and **interfaces** to achieve abstraction.

## **4.1 Abstract Classes**

An **abstract class** cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods (without implementation) that must be implemented by derived classes.

### **Example: Abstract Character Class**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public abstract class AbstractCharacter : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string characterName;
    public int health;

    // Abstract method: Must be implemented by derived classes.
    public abstract void SpecialAttack();

    // Common method for all characters.
    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        health -= damage;
        Debug.Log(characterName + " takes " + damage + " damage.");
    }
}

public class Warrior : AbstractCharacter
{
    // Implementation of the abstract method.
    public override void SpecialAttack()
    {
        Debug.Log(characterName + " performs a powerful sword slash!");
    }
}

public class Mage : AbstractCharacter
{
    // Implementation of the abstract method.
    public override void SpecialAttack()
    {
        Debug.Log(characterName + " casts a devastating fireball!");
    }
}

public class AbstractionTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // You cannot instantiate AbstractCharacter directly.
        AbstractCharacter warrior = new Warrior { characterName = "Conan", health = 150 };
        AbstractCharacter mage = new Mage { characterName = "Merlin", health = 100 };

        warrior.SpecialAttack();
        mage.SpecialAttack();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Abstract Class:**  
  - `AbstractCharacter` defines a template with an abstract method `SpecialAttack()`.
- **Concrete Classes:**  
  - `Warrior` and `Mage` provide specific implementations of `SpecialAttack()`.
- **Usage:**  
  - Abstraction forces derived classes to implement their unique behavior while sharing common code.

## **4.2 Interfaces**

**Interfaces** define a contract that classes must follow. They only contain method signatures and properties (without any implementation) and allow multiple inheritance of behavior.

### **Example: IInteractable Interface**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// Define an interface for interactable objects.
public interface IInteractable
{
    void Interact();
}

public class Door : MonoBehaviour, IInteractable
{
    public void Interact()
    {
        Debug.Log("Door: The door opens.");
    }
}

public class Chest : MonoBehaviour, IInteractable
{
    public void Interact()
    {
        Debug.Log("Chest: The chest reveals its treasures!");
    }
}

public class InteractionTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Create an array of IInteractable objects.
        IInteractable[] interactables = new IInteractable[2];
        interactables[0] = new Door();
        interactables[1] = new Chest();

        // Loop through and interact with each object.
        foreach (var interactable in interactables)
        {
            interactable.Interact();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Interface Definition:**  
  - `IInteractable` defines a contract with the `Interact()` method.
- **Implementation:**  
  - `Door` and `Chest` implement the interface, providing their own `Interact()` behavior.
- **Multiple Implementations:**  
  - Interfaces enable different classes to be treated uniformly if they share the same contract.

---

# **5. Polymorphism**

**Polymorphism** allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common supertype. It is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

### **Example: Method Overriding with Polymorphism**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Animal : MonoBehaviour
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("Dog: Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("Cat: Meow!");
    }
}

public class PolymorphismTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        // Although animal1 and animal2 are of type Animal, the overridden Speak() is called.
        animal1.Speak();  // Outputs: "Dog: Woof!"
        animal2.Speak();  // Outputs: "Cat: Meow!"
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Virtual & Override:**  
  - The `Speak()` method in `Animal` is marked as virtual, allowing derived classes to override it.
- **Polymorphic Behavior:**  
  - Even when treated as `Animal` objects, the specific implementations in `Dog` and `Cat` are invoked.

# **6. Constructors, Destructors, and Static Members**

## **6.1 Constructors**

Constructors initialize new objects. In Unity, constructors are less commonly used with MonoBehaviours (as Unity manages their lifecycle) but are still essential for non-MonoBehaviour classes.

### **Example: Using Constructors**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Potion
{
    public string potionName;
    public int healingAmount;

    // Constructor
    public Potion(string name, int healing)
    {
        potionName = name;
        healingAmount = healing;
    }

    public void Use()
    {
        Debug.Log("Using " + potionName + " to heal " + healingAmount + " health.");
    }
}

public class PotionTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Potion healthPotion = new Potion("Health Potion", 25);
        healthPotion.Use();
    }
}
```

## **6.2 Destructors (Finalizers)**

Destructors are rarely used in C# due to garbage collection. They allow you to clean up unmanaged resources if needed.

```csharp
public class ResourceHandler
{
    // Destructor (Finalizer)
    ~ResourceHandler()
    {
        // Clean up unmanaged resources here.
    }
}
```

## **6.3 Static Members**

Static members belong to the class itself rather than any instance. They can be useful for utility functions or global state (use carefully).

### **Example: Static Members**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static int score = 0;

    public static void AddScore(int amount)
    {
        score += amount;
        Debug.Log("New Score: " + score);
    }
}

public class ScoreTester : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        GameManager.AddScore(10);
        GameManager.AddScore(20);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Static Variables and Methods:**  
  - `score` and `AddScore()` belong to the `GameManager` class, and can be accessed without an instance.

# **7. Unity-Specific OOP Concepts**

Unity’s architecture leverages OOP through components, GameObjects, and ScriptableObjects.

## **7.1 Components and GameObjects**

Every script in Unity is a class that typically inherits from `MonoBehaviour`. These scripts become **components** that you attach to **GameObjects**. This composition-over-inheritance approach allows you to build complex behaviors by combining simple components.

### **Example: Component-Based Design**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

// This script represents a movement component.
public class Mover : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 5f;

    void Update()
    {
        // Simple movement: Move the GameObject forward continuously.
        transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * speed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}

// This script represents a health component.
public class Health : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int currentHealth = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        currentHealth -= damage;
        Debug.Log(gameObject.name + " now has " + currentHealth + " health.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Composition:**  
  - Attach `Mover` and `Health` components to a GameObject to give it movement and health behavior.
- **Modularity:**  
  - Each component handles its own responsibilities, making it easier to maintain and reuse code.

## **7.2 ScriptableObjects**

ScriptableObjects are a special type of data container in Unity that let you store large amounts of shared data independently of class instances.

### **Example: ScriptableObject for Game Data**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "GameData", menuName = "ScriptableObjects/GameData", order = 1)]
public class GameData : ScriptableObject
{
    public int highScore;
    public string playerName;
}
```

**Usage:**
- Create a GameData asset in your project.
- Reference it from scripts to access or modify shared data.
