### **Interfaces and Abstract Classes in C# (Unity)**

#### **1. Interfaces**
An **interface** in C# defines a contract that classes must follow but does not provide any implementation. It's like a blueprint specifying which methods or properties a class should implement.

- Interfaces **cannot have fields**.
- All methods in an interface are **implicitly public and abstract**.
- A class can **implement multiple interfaces** (unlike inheritance, which allows only one base class).

##### **Example: Implementing an Interface**
```csharp
// Define an interface
public interface IDamageable
{
    void TakeDamage(int amount);
}

// Implementing the interface in a class
public class Player : IDamageable
{
    public int health = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log("Player took damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Another class implementing the same interface
public class Enemy : IDamageable
{
    public int health = 50;

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log("Enemy took damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        IDamageable player = new Player();
        IDamageable enemy = new Enemy();

        player.TakeDamage(20);
        enemy.TakeDamage(10);
    }
}
```

##### **Example: Multiple Interfaces**
```csharp
// Define multiple interfaces
public interface IDamageable
{
    void TakeDamage(int amount);
}

public interface IHealable
{
    void Heal(int amount);
}

// Implementing multiple interfaces in a class
public class Player : IDamageable, IHealable
{
    public int health = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log("Player took damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }

    public void Heal(int amount)
    {
        health += amount;
        Debug.Log("Player healed: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Player player = new Player();

        player.TakeDamage(20);
        player.Heal(10);
    }
}
```

### **2. Abstract Classes**
An **abstract class** is a base class that **can have both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods**. Unlike interfaces, abstract classes **can have fields, constructors, and full method implementations**.

- **Cannot be instantiated** directly.
- **Can have fields and constructors**.
- **Can provide default method implementations**.
- A class **can inherit only one abstract class** (unlike interfaces).

##### **Example: Abstract Class Usage**
```csharp
// Abstract class with both abstract and concrete methods
public abstract class Character
{
    public int health = 100;

    public abstract void TakeDamage(int amount); // Abstract method

    public void Heal(int amount) // Concrete method
    {
        health += amount;
        Debug.Log("Healed by: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Derived class implementing the abstract method
public class PlayerCharacter : Character
{
    public override void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log("Player takes damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Derived class implementing the abstract method differently
public class EnemyCharacter : Character
{
    public override void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log("Enemy takes damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Character player = new PlayerCharacter();
        Character enemy = new EnemyCharacter();

        player.TakeDamage(30);
        enemy.TakeDamage(15);

        player.Heal(20);
    }
}
```

##### **Example: Abstract Class with Constructor**
```csharp
// Abstract class with a constructor
public abstract class Character
{
    public string name;
    public int health;

    public Character(string name, int health)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
    }

    public abstract void TakeDamage(int amount); // Abstract method

    public void Heal(int amount) // Concrete method
    {
        health += amount;
        Debug.Log(name + " healed by: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Derived class implementing the abstract method
public class PlayerCharacter : Character
{
    public PlayerCharacter(string name) : base(name, 100) { }

    public override void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        health -= amount;
        Debug.Log(name + " takes damage: " + amount + ", Health: " + health);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Character player = new PlayerCharacter("Hero");

        player.TakeDamage(30);
        player.Heal(20);
    }
}
```

### **Virtual and Override Keywords**
#### **3. Virtual Keyword**
The `virtual` keyword allows a method to be **overridden in a derived class** but **also provides a default implementation** if not overridden.

##### **Example: Virtual Method**
```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Debug.Log("Cat meows");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.Speak(); // Output: Dog barks
        myCat.Speak(); // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

---
#### **4. Override Keyword**
The `override` keyword is used in a derived class to **override a virtual or abstract method** from a base class.

##### **Example: Overriding a Virtual Method**
```csharp
public class Vehicle
{
    public virtual void StartEngine()
    {
        Debug.Log("Vehicle engine started");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void StartEngine()
    {
        Debug.Log("Car engine started with a key");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle : Vehicle
{
    public override void StartEngine()
    {
        Debug.Log("Motorcycle engine started with a button");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        Vehicle myBike = new Motorcycle();

        myCar.StartEngine(); // Output: Car engine started with a key
        myBike.StartEngine(); // Output: Motorcycle engine started with a button
    }
}
```

### **Combining Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Virtual Methods**
You can combine **abstract classes, interfaces, and virtual methods** to create flexible and scalable architectures in Unity.

##### **Example: Full Implementation**
```csharp
// Interface
public interface IMovable
{
    void Move();
}

// Abstract class
public abstract class Character : IMovable
{
    public string name;
    public int health;

    public Character(string name, int health)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
    }

    public abstract void Attack(); // Abstract method

    public virtual void Defend() // Virtual method
    {
        Debug.Log(name + " is defending!");
    }

    public void Move() // Interface implementation
    {
        Debug.Log(name + " is moving.");
    }
}

// Derived class
public class Warrior : Character
{
    public Warrior(string name) : base(name, 150) { }

    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(name + " swings a sword!");
    }
}

// Derived class
public class Mage : Character
{
    public Mage(string name) : base(name, 100) { }

    public override void Attack()
    {
        Debug.Log(name + " casts a fireball!");
    }

    public override void Defend()
    {
        Debug.Log(name + " creates a magical shield!");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Character warrior = new Warrior("Thor");
        Character mage = new Mage("Merlin");

        warrior.Attack();
        mage.Attack();

        warrior.Defend(); // Uses base class version
        mage.Defend(); // Uses overridden version

        warrior.Move();
        mage.Move();
    }
}
```

### **When to Use What?**
| Feature | When to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Interface** | When you need multiple unrelated classes to follow the same contract but don't need shared logic. |
| **Abstract Class** | When you want to define a base class with common logic and require derived classes to implement specific behavior. |
| **Virtual Method** | When you want a base method with a default implementation that can optionally be overridden. |
| **Override Keyword** | When you want to change the behavior of a virtual or abstract method in a derived class. |

These concepts are useful in Unity for implementing **damage systems, AI behavior, UI elements, and more** while keeping your code flexible and reusable.
